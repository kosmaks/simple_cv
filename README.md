University project made for studying purposes only.

Program takes image as an input and shows what shapes
it contains.

Currently only dots, lines, triangles, rectangles and 
circles are being detected.

It uses Hough transformation to detect circles, simple
recursive alogorithms for detecting closed contours,
Harris detection algorithm for corner detection and 
so on.

All images are PGM.
